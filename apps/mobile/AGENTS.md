# Mobile app — Vite + react-native-web

This app was migrated off Expo. It now runs in the browser only:

- **Bundler/dev server:** Vite (`npm run dev`, port 5174). No Metro, no Expo CLI.
- **Runtime:** `react-native` is aliased to `react-native-web` in `vite.config.ts`.
- **Removed Expo modules** are replaced by small local shims in `src/shims/`:
  - `expo-linear-gradient` → CSS `linear-gradient` on a View
  - `expo-image-picker` → hidden `<input type="file">`
  - `@expo/vector-icons` (`Feather`, `Ionicons`) → inline SVG, only the glyphs in use
- **Fonts:** `src/fonts.css` defines `@font-face`s (named to match `src/theme/tokens.ts`) from the `@fontsource/*` packages.
- **Env:** Vite vars — `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (see `.env.example`).
- **Entry:** `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` → `App.tsx`.

There are no native (iOS/Android) targets anymore. Platform-specific files can
still use the `.web.tsx` suffix, but everything here is the web build.

## Public legal / policy pages

`assets/legal/*.html` are plain, dependency-free static pages (shared
`styles.css`) that Vite copies from `publicDir` (`assets/`) to the site root, so
they serve at `/legal/index.html`, `/legal/terms.html`, `/legal/privacy.html`,
`/legal/refund.html`, `/legal/shipping.html`, `/legal/pricing.html`,
`/legal/contact.html`. They exist for payment-gateway (Razorpay) merchant
activation, which requires publicly reachable Terms, Privacy, Refund/Cancellation,
Shipping/Delivery, Pricing and Contact pages, and are linked from
`PaymentScreen` (`LEGAL_LINKS`).

Entity: **Matrigyan Private Limited** (Pvt Ltd; GSTIN `19AAQCM7780C1ZY`, West
Bengal; registered office JL No. 185, Balia, Salua, Kharagpur, Paschim Medinipur,
WB 721145; directors Santosh Behara & Priya Devi) owns/operates ReelSpark at
`https://reelspark.in`. The ₹300 annual fee is described as **GST-inclusive**.
The pages describe the registration fee as an **annual** fee (12-month access,
non-refundable once access is enabled, no auto-renew) and referral withdrawals as
paid within **2 working days** — note this differs from the current DB behaviour,
where `profiles.payment_status='approved'` never expires (payment is still
effectively one-time in code). Support contact: `support@reelspark.in`,
`+91 89273 49105`. Only `[CIN …]` on `contact.html` is left as an optional
fill-in; the fee/bonus figures (₹300 / ₹50 / ₹150) are taken from `app_settings`
defaults — keep `pricing.html` in sync if they change.

## Responsive layout

`src/theme/responsive.ts` exports `useResponsive()` (built on `useWindowDimensions`,
so it re-renders on resize). Breakpoints: phone `<768`, `sidebar` (left nav) `≥1000`,
desktop `≥1024`, wide `≥1440`.

- **Nav:** `MainTabNavigator` uses a bottom tab bar below 1000px and a left nav
  rail (`material`, `tabBarPosition: 'left'`) at `≥1000` (`sidebarNav`).
- **Feed:** full-bleed on phone/tablet (`<1000px`); on desktop (`feedDesktop`,
  `≥1000px`) it's a centered 9:16 phone-frame card (`width` capped at 460, height
  locked to `width*16/9`) on the dark canvas with an up/down chevron column
  beside it — the reel is never cropped on wide monitors. `FeedScreen` seeds item
  height from the window and corrects it via `onLayout` (list is `key`ed on the
  card height so it remounts, keeping item height === snapToInterval ===
  getItemLayout length). Because the playing `<iframe>` swallows wheel + key
  events, desktop advances the feed by index (`listRef.scrollToIndex`): a stage
  `wheel` listener (one reel per gesture, `preventDefault`s native scroll),
  `keydown` on `window` while the screen `useIsFocused()` (↑/↓, PageUp/PageDown,
  Space, j/k), and the chevron buttons — all via `goBy(±1)`. The YouTube embed
  (`youtubeEmbedHtml.ts`) sizes its player to the **9:16 frame itself** and lets
  YouTube's embed player cover-fit the clip: a true Short fills the frame with no
  crop, a landscape clip centre-crops to fill it. (Sizing the player as a 16:9
  box wider than the frame — the previous approach — made YouTube cover-fit a
  vertical Short to that over-wide box and zoom ~3x, cropping the Short away.)
  **Tap-to-play (YouTube):** a YouTube reel does **not** autoplay on scroll-in.
  `FeedItem` leaves `playing` false while the item is active and shows a
  full-bleed `Pressable` over the poster with a centred play glyph; tapping it
  flips `playing` true, which mounts the embed — the player then self-starts
  muted (`autoplay: 1` + `playVideo()` in `onReady`, `youtubeEmbedHtml.ts`) off
  that same gesture. Once running, tapping the reel pauses/resumes it via the
  embed's `#tap` layer, which does **not** re-trigger the `isActive` effect, so
  a manual pause sticks until the item scrolls out and back in. This is
  deliberate: an in-app YouTube play is only ever a real, user-initiated watch —
  the only kind YouTube itself might count toward the video's public view total
  (see **View counting**). Scrolling the item away flips `playing`/`started`
  false and unmounts the iframe. The paused poster is a raw
  `<img>` (RNW `<Image>` ignores `resizeMode` here) using YouTube's 9:16
  `oardefault.jpg` (`lib/ytThumb.ts`), heavily blurred + darkened as a backdrop.
  The creator/caption row, the action rail (like/comment/share/views) and the bottom
  scrim **stay visible while the reel plays** (`box-none` so only the buttons
  take taps); the full dim, top scrim and "For You" tag show only while stopped.
- **Instagram:** `VideoPlayer` loads `/reel/<id>/embed/` **directly** as an
  `<iframe src>` inside a clipping `<div>` (nesting it in a srcDoc frame gave the
  inner frame an opaque origin and stopped IG playing on tap; a CSS
  `transform: scale()` broke touch taps on mobile the same way). It hides IG's
  chrome with **plain layout**: the iframe is rendered `INSTAGRAM_SCALE`× wider
  than the clip (IG lays its page out to that width so the reel's media grows
  with it), pulled up `INSTAGRAM_HEADER_PX` and made `INSTAGRAM_EXTRA_HEIGHT_PX`
  taller than the clip so IG's header/footer sit outside it; the extra width
  spills evenly past both sides and is cropped. `INSTAGRAM_SCALE` is a
  compromise (1.5) — enough that the reel's framing stays close to Instagram's
  rather than the ~1.9 it takes to physically push IG's footer off the clip;
  `VideoPlayer` then lays the same top + bottom fading scrims the YouTube embed
  uses over the clip (`INSTAGRAM_MASK_TOP_*` / `INSTAGRAM_MASK_BOTTOM_*` in
  `instagramEmbedHtml.ts`): the top strip is header padding, the bottom strip is
  footer padding and stays opaque long enough to hide IG's like/caption/"more on
  Instagram" text.
  IG can't autoplay and its centre play button lives on instagram.com's origin,
  so it can't be scripted or hidden — instead `FeedItem` mounts the IG iframe as
  soon as the item is active (no app poster / play button on top), so a single
  tap lands on IG's own control and its button clears itself once the reel plays.
  The view is counted when an IG item scrolls in (the tap can't be observed
  inside the iframe); IG items have no "ended" event so they don't auto-advance,
  and IG's centre **"Watch again on Instagram"** replay card after a reel ends is
  likewise inside IG's cross-origin iframe and can't be removed from our side —
  only playing the raw `.mp4` avoids it.
- **View counting:** `view_count_in_app` (on `videos`) is bumped through the
  `increment_view_count` RPC (`supabase/migrations/0009_dedupe_video_views.sql`),
  which is deduped server-side, not client-side — it inserts a
  `(video_id, viewer_id)` row into `video_views` (PK, so a repeat call is a
  no-op) and only increments the counter when that insert actually happened,
  returning whether it did. `FeedItem`'s `countedView` ref (`FeedScreen.tsx`)
  just guards against firing the RPC twice within one mount; the real
  once-per-user guarantee (across sessions, reloads, re-scrolling past an item)
  is the DB unique constraint. The client only bumps the on-screen count
  optimistically when the RPC reports a new view, so a re-watch doesn't show a
  bogus increment.
  **When the view is counted differs by platform.** Instagram: on scroll-in —
  the tap that starts an IG reel is inside its cross-origin iframe and can't be
  observed. YouTube: only after **≈30s of real playback** accumulates (or a
  near-complete watch of a shorter clip). `youtubeEmbedHtml.ts` runs a 1s
  accumulator while the player is `PLAYING` (pauses freeze it, they don't reset
  it; scrolling the reel away unmounts the iframe and drops it) and posts
  `watched` once at `WATCH_THRESHOLD_SECONDS`; `VideoPlayer` forwards that as
  `onWatched`, and `FeedItem` calls the same `countView()` off it. Combined with
  tap-to-play (above), that means an in-app YouTube view corresponds to a
  genuine, user-initiated ~30s watch — the profile of a view YouTube's own
  systems may also count toward the real video.
  There is still **no mechanism (and no API) to push a view directly onto
  YouTube/Instagram** — neither platform exposes a way to increment another
  video's count, and no URL form or embed flag is a "count this view" switch.
  Whether an embedded watch counts is entirely YouTube's call; this design only
  stops the app from counting plays YouTube never would, and never presents
  `view_count_in_app` as the real platform total (the rail label and the admin
  video detail both say "in-app views" on purpose).
  **The full set of levers we have to raise the counted fraction on YouTube,
  and nothing more:** (1) play through YouTube's official IFrame Player — done;
  (2) tap-to-play, so every play is user-initiated — done; (3) ≥30s watch before
  it counts (`WATCH_THRESHOLD_SECONDS`) — done; (4) audible by default
  (`soundOn` starts `true` in `FeedScreen.tsx` — a muted play is a weaker
  signal); (5) no auto-advance / no auto-loop (`handleEnded` just stops);
  (6) `widget_referrer` on the embed so the play shows up as `reelspark.app`
  under Traffic source -> External in the creator's YouTube Analytics (this is
  attribution only, still not a view guarantee). **Instagram has none of these
  levers** — its `/embed/` iframe is cross-origin and unscriptable, so play,
  watch-time and completion are all unobservable and there is nothing to tune;
  the IG in-app view is counted on scroll-in and that is the end of what's
  possible there. The only way to get *guaranteed* real platform views is to
  send the viewer to youtube.com / instagram.com itself, which the product has
  chosen not to do.
- **Likes + comments:** DB in `supabase/migrations/0012_likes_comments.sql`.
  `videos` gains denormalised `like_count` / `comment_count` columns kept in sync
  by triggers, so `get_feed_page` (which is `select *` off `public.videos`)
  returns them with no join or function change. `video_likes` (PK
  `(video_id, user_id)`) and `video_comments` (soft-deleted via `is_deleted`) are
  both readable by **any** authenticated user for an approved video, and any
  authenticated user can like/unlike (`toggle_video_like(p_video_id)` RPC,
  `security definer`, returns the resulting liked state) and post/delete their
  own comments (plain RLS'd inserts/updates). `useFeed` does one extra
  `video_likes` query per page to set `liked_by_me` on each row for the heart's
  initial state. `FeedItem` holds `liked` / `likeCount` / `commentCount` in local
  state (seeded from the feed row, updated optimistically then reconciled against
  the RPC's return); the heart + comment buttons sit at the top of the action
  rail with the exact count under each — **no count is shown while it's 0**.
  Tapping the comment button opens `CommentsSheet`
  (`src/components/CommentsSheet.tsx`) — a bottom sheet with an infinite list
  (`useComments`, newest first, joins `profiles` for author name/avatar) and an
  input row (`useAddComment` / `useDeleteComment`). The reel pauses while the
  sheet is open (`showReel && !commentsOpen`). Comment adds/removes bump the
  reel's local `commentCount` via `onCountDelta` rather than refetching the feed
  (which would reset scroll position).
- **My Videos:** `FlatList` `numColumns` = `useResponsive().gridColumns` (1 → 4).
- **Form / content screens** (auth, Submit, Edit/Profile): the root `screen` style
  gets `maxWidth` + `alignSelf: 'center'` so content stays a readable column.

## Paid registration + referrals

DB: `supabase/migrations/0006_registration_payments_referrals.sql` +
`0010_manual_upi_payments.sql` (0007/0008/0009 also apply in between — run in
order). `profiles.payment_status` (`unpaid|submitted|approved|rejected`) gates
`videos` inserts via the `check_can_post` trigger; `MainStackNavigator` wraps
the tabs so `PaymentScreen` can be pushed over browse-only tabs. `SubmitScreen`
shows `<PaymentGate>` until `payment_status === 'approved'`.

Payment is **manual UPI**, not a payment gateway: `PaymentScreen` renders a
`upi://pay?pa=<upi_id>&pn=<payee>&am=<fee>&cu=INR` QR (`PaymentQrCode.tsx`,
generated client-side with the `qrcode` package — a data URI, not a stored
image, so it always reflects the live `app_settings.upi_id`/`upi_payee_name`)
plus the UPI ID as copyable text. The user pays with any UPI app, then enters
their UTR/transaction reference and attaches a screenshot (`expo-image-picker`
shim); submitting uploads the screenshot to the private `payment-proofs`
storage bucket (`<user_id>/<timestamp>.jpg`) and calls
`submit_registration_payment(p_upi_reference, p_screenshot_path)`, which
requires both and flips the row + profile to `submitted`. An admin reviews it
on the admin **Payments** page (screenshot shown via a signed URL) and calls
`approve_registration_payment` / `reject_registration_payment`; approval
credits the referrer `app_settings.referral_bonus_inr` once per payment.
`useRegistrationPayment` polls while `submitted`. There is no automatic
approval path — a payment is only ever approved by an admin looking at the
UTR and screenshot. (An earlier iteration used Razorpay Checkout for
automatic verification; 0010 reverted it because the product now wants manual
UTR + screenshot review instead.) Referral code entered at sign-up
(`options.data.referral_code`); balance shown on `ProfileScreen`. The Profile card
shares an invite link `<origin>/?ref=CODE`; `src/lib/referral.ts` lifts `?ref=` on
app start (`App.tsx`) into `sessionStorage`, `AuthNavigator` then opens on `SignUp`
with the code pre-filled.

## Referral wallet + withdrawals

DB: `supabase/migrations/0008_referral_withdrawals.sql`. `app_settings` gains
`min_referral_withdrawal_inr` (default ₹150, editable from admin **Settings**).
`ReferralWalletScreen` (ProfileStack, linked from the Profile referral card)
shows the balance, a withdraw form (amount + UPI ID), and a merged transaction
list of `referral_earnings` (credits) and `referral_withdrawals` (debits) —
`useReferralWallet` hook. Withdrawing calls the `request_referral_withdrawal`
RPC, which is **auto-approved**: it locks the profile row, checks the amount is
≥ the minimum and ≤ the balance, debits `referral_balance_inr`, and writes a
`paid` `referral_withdrawals` row in one transaction. Admins see every
withdrawal (global + per user, with per-user earned/paid/balance rollups) on the
admin **Referrals** page and can `set_referral_withdrawal_status` to
`failed`/`reversed` (refunds the balance) or back to `paid` (re-debits).
